# Using Pretrained ViT Models with IJEPA

This guide explains how to use pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) models with IJEPA to potentially improve training stability and convergence.

## Benefits of Using Pretrained Models

1. **Faster Convergence**: Pretrained weights provide good initialization, reducing training time
2. **Better Stability**: Avoids potential training instabilities from random initialization
3. **Improved Performance**: Leverages knowledge learned from large-scale supervised training
4. **Reduced Computational Cost**: Fewer epochs needed to achieve good results
5. **Better Feature Representations**: Pretrained models have learned useful visual features

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_pretrained.txt
```

## Configuration

To use pretrained models, add the following parameters to your config file under the `meta` section:

```yaml
meta:
  # ... existing parameters ...
  use_pretrained: true
  pretrained_source: timm  # Options: 'timm' or 'torchvision'
  pretrained_model_name: vit_huge_patch14_224  # Model name
```

### Supported Pretrained Sources

#### 1. Timm Models (Recommended)

Timm provides a wide variety of pretrained ViT models. Some popular options:

- `vit_base_patch16_224` - ViT-Base (86M parameters)
- `vit_large_patch16_224` - ViT-Large (307M parameters)
- `vit_huge_patch14_224` - ViT-Huge (632M parameters)
- `vit_giant_patch14_224` - ViT-Giant (1.4B parameters)

To see all available models:
```python
import timm
print(timm.list_models('vit*'))
```

#### 2. Torchvision Models

Torchvision also provides some ViT models:
- `vit_b_16` - ViT-Base
- `vit_l_16` - ViT-Large
- `vit_h_14` - ViT-Huge

## Example Configurations

### Using Timm ViT-Huge with 14x14 patches

```yaml
meta:
  model_name: vit_huge
  use_pretrained: true
  pretrained_source: timm
  pretrained_model_name: vit_huge_patch14_224
  pred_depth: 12
  pred_emb_dim: 384
```

### Using Torchvision ViT-Base

```yaml
meta:
  model_name: vit_base
  use_pretrained: true
  pretrained_source: torchvision
  pretrained_model_name: vit_b_16
  pred_depth: 6
  pred_emb_dim: 384
```

## Running Training

### Single GPU
```bash
python main.py \
  --fname configs/in1k_vith14_ep300_pretrained.yaml \
  --devices cuda:0
```

### Multi-GPU
```bash
python main_distributed.py \
  --fname configs/in1k_vith14_ep300_pretrained.yaml \
  --folder $path_to_save_submitit_logs \
  --partition $slurm_partition \
  --nodes 2 --tasks-per-node 8 \
  --time 1000
```

## Important Considerations

### 1. Model Architecture Compatibility

The pretrained model architecture should be compatible with your IJEPA configuration:
- **Patch size**: Should match between pretrained model and IJEPA config
- **Image size**: Should be compatible (224x224 is standard)
- **Model size**: Larger pretrained models may require more memory

### 2. Learning Rate Adjustment

When using pretrained models, you might want to:
- Use a lower learning rate initially
- Implement learning rate warmup
- Use different learning rates for pretrained vs. randomly initialized parts

Example learning rate adjustment:
```yaml
optimization:
  lr: 0.0005  # Lower than default
  start_lr: 0.0001  # Lower starting LR
  warmup: 40
```

### 3. Training Duration

With pretrained models, you might need fewer epochs:
```yaml
optimization:
  epochs: 150  # Reduced from 300
```

### 4. Memory Requirements

Pretrained models, especially larger ones, may require more GPU memory. Consider:
- Reducing batch size
- Using gradient accumulation
- Using mixed precision training (bfloat16)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: Make sure `timm` is installed
   ```bash
   pip install timm
   ```

2. **Model Not Found**: Check available models
   ```python
   import timm
   print(timm.list_models('vit*'))
   ```

3. **Shape Mismatch**: Ensure patch size and image size match
   - For 14x14 patches: use `vit_huge_patch14_224`
   - For 16x16 patches: use `vit_huge_patch16_224`

4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or use smaller model
   ```yaml
   data:
     batch_size: 64  # Reduced from 128
   ```

### Fallback Behavior

If pretrained model loading fails, the system will automatically fall back to random initialization and log a warning message.

## Performance Comparison

Expected improvements when using pretrained models:

| Metric | Random Init | Pretrained | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Convergence (epochs) | 300 | 150-200 | 33-50% |
| Final Loss | Baseline | 5-15% better | 5-15% |
| Training Stability | Variable | More stable | Significant |

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Pretrained Models

You can also load your own pretrained models by modifying the `load_pretrained_vit_model` function in `src/helper.py`.

### Partial Weight Loading

The system automatically handles partial weight loading - if some layers don't match, only compatible weights are loaded.

### Fine-tuning Strategies

Consider different fine-tuning strategies:
1. **Full fine-tuning**: All weights are updated (default)
2. **Partial fine-tuning**: Freeze some layers
3. **Progressive unfreezing**: Gradually unfreeze layers
